# ðŸ”§ Fix Vercel 404 - Test Interface Routing Issue

## Problem
The test interface route `/student/test-interface/:testId` is returning 404 on Vercel because of React Router configuration issues.

## Root Cause
The nested routing structure in App.tsx is causing route conflicts. The test interface route is being shadowed by the catch-all `/*` pattern.

## Solution: Fix React Router Configuration

### Step 1: Update App.tsx Routing Structure

Replace the current nested routing structure with a flat structure that properly handles all routes.

### Step 2: Ensure Vercel Configuration is Correct

The `vercel.json` already has the correct SPA configuration, but let's verify it's working properly.

### Step 3: Deploy the Fix

After fixing the routing, redeploy the frontend to Vercel.

## Quick Fix Instructions:

1. **Update the routing in App.tsx**
2. **Verify vercel.json configuration** 
3. **Redeploy frontend**
4. **Test the route**

## Expected Result:
âœ… `/student/test-interface/:testId` should load properly
âœ… Test interface opens in new tab without 404 errors
âœ… All other routes continue working normally

## Next Steps:
I'll implement the routing fix now...
